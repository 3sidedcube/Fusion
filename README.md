## What motivated the name "Fusion"?

Fusion here means to bring together two platforms, iOS and Android, powered by a single data source.  
For web-server apps, the business logic should sit server-side as much as possible.
Fusion aims to be as simple as "server tell me what to draw and I'll draw it".

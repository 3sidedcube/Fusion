/// The `RowConvertible` conformance for the `class` `ListItem` is done in
/// the `class` itself to allow overriding in subclasses.
/// This file has been added as a placeholder as `RowConvertible` conformance is normally
/// done in it's own file for `struct` types.
///
/// As `Bullet` inherits `ListItem` it is also done in the `Bullet` class.
